# SwiftChatter

SwiftChatter is a Swift program, with intents to help Computers understand basic grammar without Artificial Intelligence.
The project initially started as PyChatter, with the same intents, but with the Python programming language; however, Swift seemed better in writing complex programs with loops (which this program is).

It is written by Joonsung Kim.
